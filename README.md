## Notes about this forked version
This is a fork of the package: agares/laravel-onesky, but since it seems inactive, I'm maintaining a version here. 
The namespaces are still the same, so the only thing you have to do to migrate to this package, 
is replacing the installation like so:

```bash
composer remove ageras/laravel-onesky \
    && composer require roelofjan-elsinga/laravel-onesky
```

## Description
A seamless integration between Laravel and the Onesky API.

By using artisan commands you can easily push new phrases ready for translation and pull translated phrases ready for production.

## Installation

Require this package using composer:
```
composer require roelofjan-elsinga/laravel-onesky
```

### Which version to use?
- 1.0.0 uses Laravel 5.8
- 2.0.0 uses Laravel 6.0
- 3.0.0 uses Laravel 7.0

## Usage

Copy the package config to your local config with the publish command:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Ageras\LaravelOneSky\ServiceProvider"
```

Change the newly published `onesky.php` file so that it matches your project.

Next, add `ONESKY_API_KEY` and `ONESKY_SECRET` to your `.env` file.

When you are ready to translate your language files, use this simple artisan command to upload them to your OneSky account:
```
php artisan onesky:push
```

When your language files have been translated, use this command to download them directly into your project:
```
php artisan onesky:pull
```

If you only want certain languages to be pulled, you can use the `--lang=` flag:
```
php artisan onesky:pull --lang=en,da,no
```

If you have multiple projects, you can use the `--project=` flag to specify the id:
```
php artisan onesky:push --project=1337
```
